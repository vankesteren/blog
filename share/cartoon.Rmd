## 0 -- Establishing shot
_Establishing shot of for example the outside of the classroom looking in with a creative twist on the "two groups" theme from the text. (looking at two very different classrooms?)_

> Imagine that we are doing research on two groups. Our null hypothesis $H_0$ is that the group means are equal, our alternative hypothesis $H_1$ is that they differ. 

## 1 -- H$_0$

_The first image of Sunday in front of the blackboard/whiteboard_

> If $H_0$ is true, all possible _p_-values are equally likely. We say that it is uniformly distributed.

```{r beta11, fig.width=5, fig.height=5, fig.align="center"}
par(mar = c(4,5,3,1))
plot(x, dbeta(x, 1, 1), 
     type = "l", xlim = c(0,1), ylim = c(0,6), bty = "L", 
     axes = F, ylab = "", xlab = "", 
     col = "dark blue", lwd = 2, cex = 1.7)
axis(2, at = c(0,1,6), lwd = 2, cex = 1.7, las=1)
axis(1, at = c(0,1), lwd = 2, cex = 1.7)

mtext(side= 3, expression(bold("No Effect")), cex=1.5)
mtext(side = 2, expression(italic("f")*"("*italic("p")*"|H)"), line = 1, las=1, cex = 1.5)
mtext(side=1, expression(italic("p")*"-value"), line=1.5, cex=1.5)
```

## 2 -- H$_1$
_A (slightly different?) image of Sunday in front of the blackboard/whiteboard. This image could be wide to accommodate the two plots side-by-side_

> Instead, when $H_1$ is true, lower _p_-values are more likely than higher ones. By studying _p_-values, Sellke, Bayarri, and Berger (2001) showed that they are roughly _beta_ distributed. Let's look at the most interesting part of the $p$-value distribution: the lowest values from 0 to 0.2.


```{r betasmall, fig.width=5, fig.height=5, fig.align="center"}
# Small effect
par(mar = c(4,5,3,1))

```
```{r betalarge, fig.width=5, fig.height=5, fig.align="center"}
# Large effect
par(mar = c(4,5,3,1))
plot(x2, dbeta(x2, 0.1, 1), 
     type = "l", xlim = c(0,0.2), ylim = c(0,6), bty = "L",

```


## 3 -- Diagnosticity

> The __diagnosticity__ of a _p_-value is to what extent that _p_-value is more likely under the alternative hypothesis $H_1$ than under the null hypothesis $H_0$. 
To understand this better, let's consider two "worlds": 


## 4 -- Two worlds
_See the panel idea in the drawing below. Here, $\mathcal{N}$ means normal distribution._

<img src="./worldspanel.jpeg" width="50%" style="display:block; margin:0 auto;"></img>


> in world __A__ there is a medium effect and in __B__ there is no effect. We don't know which "world" we live in, but in our statistical test we obtain a _p_-value of 0.05 -- a "significant" difference. How much more likely is it that we receive this _p_-value from world __A__ than from __B__? We can use the _p_-value distributions!

```{r worlds, fig.width=5, fig.height=5, fig.align="center"}
par(mar = c(4,5,3,1))
plot(x2, dbeta(x2, 0.8, 1), 
     type = "l", xlim = c(0,0.2), ylim = c(0,6), bty = "L", 
     axes = F, ylab = "", xlab ="", 
     col = "dark green", lwd = 2, cex = 4)
arrows(0.05, -0.5, 0.05, 0.85, length = 0.1, angle = 30, lwd = 2, code = 2, col = "red")
axis(2, at = c(0,1,round(dbeta(0.05,0.8,1),1),6), lwd = 2, cex = 1.7,las=1)
axis(1, at = c(0,0.05,0.2), lwd = 2, cex = 1.7)

             y = c(1, dbeta(0.05,0.8,1)), 
             pch = 21, bg = "grey", cex=1.5, lwd=1.5)

mtext(side=1, expression(italic("p")*"-value"), line=1.5, cex=1.5)
```

## 5 -- Closeup explanation
_Closeup of Sunday's face (with in the background still this image?_

> Because the y-axis in this plot indicates the probability of obtaining a certain _p_-value, we can immediately see the answer by looking at the ratio of probabilities: with a _p_-value of 0.05 it is 1.5 more likely that we are in world __A__. That does not seem such strong evidence in favour of world __A__!

## 6 -- Class doesn't understand yet!
_Class/student image asking a question, possibly with raised hand_

> But teacher, we could only calculate this because we knew the _true_ effect in world A! In the real world, we don't know the true effect under $H_1$, so we can't draw the green line!

## 7 -- Idea
_Back to Sunday (fun twist, maybe she can actually pick cherries?)_

> Correct, so we cheat by cherry-picking the effect size that makes $H_1$ look as good as it can be. If we do this, we obtain the _maximum p_-ratio -- the MPR: 


## 8 -- Resolution
_Whiteboard image again, perhaps Sunday pointing at the 2.5 in the image?_

> See? The maximum diagnosticity of a _p_-value of 0.05 is just under 2.5. That means that this  _p_-value is a bit less than 2.5 times more likely to appear under $H_1$ than under the null hypothesis.

## 9 -- Math
_Sunday drawing math on the whiteboard_

> Sellke, Bayarri and Berger showed that the MPR can be calculated like this for low $p$-values. This formula was first derived by Vladimir Vovk, so it's called the "Vovk-Sellke Maximum _p_-Ratio". For $p=0.05$ MPR equals 2.456!

\[\mathrm{MPR}=(-e p \ln p)^{-1} = 2.456\]


## 10 -- Software
_Screenshot of JASP, maybe Sunday behind a computer?_

> [JASP](https://www.jasp-stats.org) has an option to show the MPR for each _p_-value you obtain!

## 11 -- Critical question
_(Different?) student asking a critical question, looking confused?_

> But teacher, that's _still_ not a lot of evidence in favour of $H_1$, is it?

## 12 -- Conclusion
_Sunday standing in front of class, show the backs of the heads of the class_

> I agree! _p_-values down to 0.01 are never much more likely to occur under $H_0$ relative to $H_1$, even when we cheat to favour $H_1$. Beware of $p$-values larger than this, as the evidence for $H_1$ is not always as strong as it seems!

## 13 -- Conclusion 2
_Similar image_
> What MPR value is enough for you to believe the result? That's for you to decide. Some choose to interpret this ratio as an upper bound to the _Bayes Factor_, but that's something for another time...

> Thanks teacher!
