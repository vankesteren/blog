Let's get started!

## Why???
[R Markdown](http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com/) is an Rstudio project built for writing reproducible notebooks that integrate `R` (and possibly other) code and output. The main idea is to make this as simple as possible. This is why it was built on [Markdown](http://daringfireball.net/projects/markdown/), the widely used, easy-to-read web markup language. It looks like this:

As you can see, it is easy to read in plaintext form, it's simple to make lists, links, headers and more. Perhaps you know it from GitHub's comment system, or StackExchange comments.

The great idea of the RStudio developers was that a markup language can be used to generate documents of many different file formats: html pages (what we will be using), articles, word documents, etc. 

So why would you want to use it for blogging? Here are my reasons:

1. _I love_ `R`. May sound strange, but I feel really at home in the RStudio IDE and programming with `R` has become ...
