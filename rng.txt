Why do we need truly random numbers

Introduction = how to get random numbers from a deterministic machine

The mersenne-twister algorithm

So everything depends on the inputs: Alternatives: Random.org atmospheric radiation
lavarand: picture of lava lamp to generate random numbers: the idea is that lava-lamp is a chaotic system.

How to test for randomness: compression algorithms (related to entropy)
Only partial test, but intuitive

Test random.org against runif
